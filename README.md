# 5G User Equipment Classification

This is an idea paper that proposes a framework to classify mobile devices in a 5G Network.

Abstract:

Everyday, the number of mobile devices such as
smartphones and wearables grows exponentially. With such rapid
growth, comes the demand for a new generation of mobile
communication. Thus, the need for a highly scalable and easily
deployable network technology, 5G was born. To meet the diverse
requirements of a 5G network, the concept of Network Slicing
was introduced. 5G network slicing is a network architecture that
enables the multiplexing of virtualized and independent logical
networks on the same physical network infrastructure. However,
though the concept of 5G Network Slicing has been theorized and
even to some extent, tested, User Equipment (UE) Classification
has not been given the same attention. In this paper, we propose
a three-step architecture to classify UEs in a 5G network and
subsequently determine its appropriate Network Slice.
